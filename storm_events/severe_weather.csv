The warm weather culminated on the 6th, when Detroit reached a high of 69 degrees - the warmest reading ever in Detroit in December.  However, a powerful cold front swung through the state late in the evening on the 6th.  A thin line of showers and thunderstorms accompanied the front, moving east at about 50 mph.  Many of the storms along the line produced wind damage.  The result was a December severe weather episode - a rather uncommon event for Michigan.  Most of the wind damage occurred immediately behind the line of convection, and the majority of the damage involved the downing of trees, large limbs, and power lines.The majority of the severe weather occurred near or south of Interstate 69.  The most notable exception to this was a swath of wind damage across southern Sanilac County, from Marlette to Lexington.  Barns and silos were destroyed near Marlette, and a home was deroofed.A more spotty damage path roughly followed I-69 from Davison to Port Huron.  A National Weather Service employee estimated 60 mph wind in Davison.  Limbs and power lines were downed further east, in Lapeer and Port Huron.  Damage was also spotty across Livingston, Oakland, and Macomb Counties.  In Oakland County, the National Weather Service office in White Lake measured a 63 mph gust.  In Farmington, a home was heavily damaged when it was struck by a large evergreen.  A tree fell onto a vehicle on Middlebelt Road in West Bloomfield Township, and the two occupants suffered minor injuries.  In Birmingham, the walls of a construction project were blown over, while in Troy, a billboard was shredded by severe winds.  The city of Utica in Macomb County was especially hard hit, with many trees and power lines downed.Damage was a little heavier across Washtenaw and Wayne Counties.  A barn was destroyed near Manchester.  A 64 mph gust was measured at the University of Michigan in Ann Arbor, while Detroit Metropolitan Airport had a 60 mph gust.  In between those two sites, heavy damage occurred in Ypsilanti and at nearby Willow Run Airport.  Three apartments suffered extensive roof damage near Ypsilanti, and a home was damaged by a falling tree.  At Willow Run Airport, many planes were tossed about, resulting in the destruction of 4 planes, and damage to another half-dozen or so.  In Livonia, a metal shed was thrown into a yard two homes down from where it started.  In addition, the walls of a drug store under construction were toppled.  Nativity scenes were thrown about in Plymouth and Romulus.  An historic elm tree lost large limbs in Lincoln Park, a nearby school suffered substantial roof damage, and a dry cleaners under construction was damaged.

The warm weather culminated on the 6th, when Detroit reached a high of 69 degrees - the warmest reading ever in Detroit in December.  However, a powerful cold front swung through the state late in the evening on the 6th.  A thin line of showers and thunderstorms accompanied the front, moving east at about 50 mph.  Many of the storms along the line produced wind damage.  The result was a December severe weather episode - a rather uncommon event for Michigan.  Most of the wind damage occurred immediately behind the line of convection, and the majority of the damage involved the downing of trees, large limbs, and power lines.The majority of the severe weather occurred near or south of Interstate 69.  The most notable exception to this was a swath of wind damage across southern Sanilac County, from Marlette to Lexington.  Barns and silos were destroyed near Marlette, and a home was deroofed.A more spotty damage path roughly followed I-69 from Davison to Port Huron.  A National Weather Service employee estimated 60 mph wind in Davison.  Limbs and power lines were downed further east, in Lapeer and Port Huron.  Damage was also spotty across Livingston, Oakland, and Macomb Counties.  In Oakland County, the National Weather Service office in White Lake measured a 63 mph gust.  In Farmington, a home was heavily damaged when it was struck by a large evergreen.  A tree fell onto a vehicle on Middlebelt Road in West Bloomfield Township, and the two occupants suffered minor injuries.  In Birmingham, the walls of a construction project were blown over, while in Troy, a billboard was shredded by severe winds.  The city of Utica in Macomb County was especially hard hit, with many trees and power lines downed.Damage was a little heavier across Washtenaw and Wayne Counties.  A barn was destroyed near Manchester.  A 64 mph gust was measured at the University of Michigan in Ann Arbor, while Detroit Metropolitan Airport had a 60 mph gust.  In between those two sites, heavy damage occurred in Ypsilanti and at nearby Willow Run Airport.  Three apartments suffered extensive roof damage near Ypsilanti, and a home was damaged by a falling tree.  At Willow Run Airport, many planes were tossed about, resulting in the destruction of 4 planes, and damage to another half-dozen or so.  In Livonia, a metal shed was thrown into a yard two homes down from where it started.  In addition, the walls of a drug store under construction were toppled.  Nativity scenes were thrown about in Plymouth and Romulus.  An historic elm tree lost large limbs in Lincoln Park, a nearby school suffered substantial roof damage, and a dry cleaners under construction was damaged.  In Trenton, a trampoline became airborne and flew into nearby tree limbs and power lines, downing them.Damage was isolated in the southernmost tier of counties.  A tree fell on a home in Devils Lake, and an uprooted tree came crashing down onto a garage in Monroe.",,PDC

The associated cold front crossed the Lower Peninsula during the late afternoon and evening hours.  Severe thunderstorms developed in southern Michigan ahead of the cold front.The cluster of storms that affected southeast Michigan had produced a tornado near Battle Creek earlier in the day.  No tornadoes occurred in southeast Michigan; in fact, most of damage was only marginally severe.  The exception to this was in the small community of Mooreville in southern Washtenaw County.  Almost every residence in town suffered at least some tree damage, several cars were damaged, and the roof of a house was smashed.Elsewhere, a couple of trees were downed just southeast of Saline, as well as south of Ypsilanti.  A spotter north of Ypsilanti estimated 60 mph winds, as did the general public in Belleville.  In Ida, a tree was downed, and several telephone poles were bent by thunderstorm winds.

Afternoon temperatures rose into the 90s, with dew points in the 70s.  This produced an unstable air mass, and scattered thunderstorms developed in the evening hours.  The approach of an upper level jet allowed some thunderstorms to persist well past midnight.During the evening, severe thunderstorms sporadically produced large hail and damaging winds.  Power lines were downed by winds in Mayville, and a large tree was felled in Vassar.  Gusts of 60 mph were estimated in both Owosso and Byron.  In Clio, the problem was hail; dime sized or larger hail fell for fifteen minutes.  Golfball sized hail fell on two occasions during that time period.  Large hail was also reported in parts of Tuscola County, and in southern Genesee County.A weakening area of thunderstorms moved southeast into Washtenaw and Lenawee Counties after midnight.  These storms were still potent enough to generate severe wind gusts in the western parts of these counties.  Trees were downed in Dexter, Addison, north of Chelsea, and just west of Ann Arbor.  Law enforcement estimated a 60 mph gust near Manchester.  These storms weakened below severe limits as they continued east.",,PDC

The low moved rapidly east that night, reaching northern lower Michigan by daybreak on the 31st.  The warm front associated with the low moved north across the Lower Peninsula overnight, ushering in an unstable air mass.  A potent upper level disturbance also moved east across Michigan during the early morning hours of the 31st.  Wind speeds were extremely high aloft, with 65 mph winds located less than a half mile above ground level.Thunderstorms developed in the northern Plains during the afternoon of the 30th.  The storms organized and accelerated as they headed east.  The thunderstorm complex evolved into a serial derecho as it crossed eastern Wisconsin and Lake Michigan.  The derecho affected most of lower Michigan during the early morning hours of the 31st, producing one of the most widespread wind damage events in state history.  The derecho moved east across the state at about 70 mph.Two fatalities were directly attributed to the storms in southeast Michigan.  In Pinconning in Bay County, a woman was killed when a tree fell on her home as she slept.  In Port Crescent State Park, just southwest of Port Austin in Huron County, a tent occupied by two people was struck by a falling tree, killing one of the occupants (the other was unhurt).  Two injuries occurred at the Holly State Recreation Area in Oakland County.  Both were campers who were hurt in separate incidents by falling trees.  One suffered a possible broken leg, while the other may have suffered broken ribs.In southeast Michigan, wind damage generally increased as you went north.  Most of Metro Detroit saw only patchy wind damage.  Widespread damage began in the far northern suburbs of Detroit, and continued north into Flint, the Tri Cities, and the Thumb.  Most of the damage done to structures was caused by falling trees.Midland County was the first southeast Michigan county to experience the derecho.  Structural damage was reported in Porter, Warren, Edenville, Hope, and Jerome Townships.  Outbuildings were the most vulnerable to the wind, with many barns, sheds, and garages damaged or destroyed.  Trees and power lines down were a common sight countywide.  Consumers Power reported that thirteen thousand customers in the Midland area lost power due to the thunderstorms.Damage was widespread in Bay County.  Bay City was especially hard hit, with many trees down and a gas main broken.  The city clock tower had one of its faces torn off, and the drawbridge across the Saginaw River had all four gates snapped off.  The Coast Guard Station in nearby Essexville recorded an 81 mph wind gust.  Eleven thousand Bay City area residents were without power at the height of the storm. Again, trees and power lines down were a common problem countywide.  Crews were still cleaning up debris almost two months after the storms went through.  Public damage alone was estimated at $610,000.  President Clinton declared Bay County a Federal Disaster Area.Saginaw County also received a Federal Disaster Declaration.  Damage was most widespread in the northern and eastern parts of the county.  Townships hardest hit were Jonesfield, Richland, Bridgeport, Thomas, Birch Run, Carlton, Kochville, and Tittabawassee.  Also hard hit were the cities of Saginaw and Zilwaukee.  The Tri Cities International Airport recorded an 86 mph wind gust, while a spotter near Oakley estimated 70 mph winds.  Several homes suffered structural damage, with most of the damage again caused by fallen trees.  Public damage alone was estimated at $750,000.  Fifty-eight thousand Consumers Power customers in the Saginaw area lost power at the height of the storm, and it took over a week to get power restored in some places.The other county in southeast Michigan to receive a Federal Disaster Declaration was Shiawassee.  A spotter north of Laingsburg estimated 89 mph winds, while another spotter just northeast of Henderson reported 70 mph winds.  The hardest hit areas in the county included Owosso, Durand, and Fairfield Township.  In Owosso, over half a million dollars in damage was done to the high school alone.  About 25,000 Owosso area residents lost power during the storm.  All told, fifty homes and twenty-six businesses in Shiawassee County were damaged, along with about fifty agricultural outbuildings.  The derecho felled about five thousand trees in the county.The Thumb counties of Huron, Tuscola, and Sanilac also experienced damaging winds.  Numerous barns were deroofed in the west half of Huron County, and a pair of utility plants were damaged.  A gazebo in Wagener Park, between Harbor Beach and White Rock, was destroyed.  In Tuscola County, the wind was estimated in the 70 to 85 mph range by the Michigan State Police at their Caro post.  Property damage was extensive in the Caro area, including a tree that fell through the roof of the county building.  Unionville was also hit hard, with several homes struck by falling trees.  County officials estimated 70 mph winds in the Millington area.  Windows were blown out a home in the extreme southeast corner of the county, just west of Marlette.  Across the county line in Sanilac County, plate glass windows were blown out of downtown businesses in Brown City.  Several mobile homes in the northwest part of the county suffered extensive damage.  Numerous outbuildings were destroyed in Sanilac County, mainly in the western half.  The steeple was torn off of a church in Melvin.  Other communities that saw damage included New Greenleaf, Marlette, Peck, Deckerville, Shabonna, and Minden.The only tornado of the morning in southeast Michigan occurred in far western Genesee County.  The weak tornado only touched down for a few moments, but was observed by a spotter downing trees and damaging buildings.  Elsewhere across Genesee County, tree damage was widespread.  The Fenton area saw the most extensive damage, but Grand Blanc and Flint also had significant problems.  Over a hundred thousand Consumers Power customers in the Flint area lost power at the height of the storm.  The widespread wind damage continued east into Lapeer County, with hundreds of trees downed.  Imlay City, Lapeer, and Almont were among the hardest hit communities in Lapeer County.Still more damage occurred in the next county over, St Clair County.  Trees and power lines were down across much of the county.  Damage was most extensive in Capac, Yale, Port Huron, and Marysville.  In Port Huron, an historic elm tree - believed to be the oldest in the county - fell onto a church.  This was just one of dozens of trees to be felled in Port Huron.  All told, one home in St Clair County was destroyed, and thirty were damaged.Livingston County was yet another county that saw widespread damage to trees and power lines, although the damage was not quite as extensive.  A National Weather Service employee estimated 60 mph winds near Brighton.  Fowlerville, Howell, and Hartland also experienced severe winds.  In Oakland County, damage was heavy and extensive in the northern part of the county.  A gust of 67 mph was measured at the National Weather Service office in White Lake, while a Weather Service employee measured 61 mph winds in Oxford.  Several homes in the Oxford area suffered roof damage, two large signs were downed, and a trampoline simply disappeared.  Holly, Ortonville, Clarkston, and Orion Township also saw substantial damage to trees.  Further south, damage became patchy.  A swath of damaging winds downed trees from South Lyon east to Novi.  A lightning strike in South Lyon started a house fire.  Gusts estimated at 70 mph knocked boats off of hoists on Cass Lake.In Macomb County, extensive damage occurred in the village of Armada.  Winds estimated at 90 mph downed dozens of trees in the village.  The Governor of Michigan declared Armada a state disaster area.  This swath of damage started southwest of Armada in Romeo, where trees and lines were downed.  The swath continued east of Armada to Richmond - where a barn was destroyed - and Memphis - where two homes were damaged by fallen trees.  Damage was only patchy in the southern part of Macomb County, with tree damage reported in Fraser and St Clair Shores.  Twenty homes and ten businesses were damaged in Macomb County.Only the trailing edge of the derecho crossed Washtenaw and Wayne Counties, and the thunderstorms there moved much more slowly.  Wind damage was therefore nowhere near as extensive.  Power lines were downed in the Dexter area in Washtenaw County.  Lightning triggered a house fire in Ypsilanti.  In Wayne County, trees and power lines were downed in Northville and Livonia.  A pocket of damage also occurred in Dearborn, where a church steeple was damaged, a garage was hit by a falling utility pole, and a house was struck by lightning.  All told, 215,000 Detroit Edison customers lost power at some point in the storm.To wind up the event, an isolated severe thunderstorm developed on the southern edge of the derecho as it was moving east into Ontario.  This cell produced large hail in Rockwood and South Rockwood.",,PDC

An extremely humid airmass was also in place, with dew points in the upper 70s.  The above produced an extraordinarily unstable atmosphere, with CAPE values approaching 7000 J/kg.  A weak trough of low pressure moved east into western lower Michigan during the afternoon.  It was on this trough that thunderstorms first developed.  Thanks to the amount of instability present, these storms rapidly became severe.  Winds aloft were rather strong for mid-summer, with 40 knot winds less than a mile above ground level (at 850 mb).  Thus, the storms were prodigious producers of damaging wind gusts.Tragedy struck during the early evening in the downriver suburbs of Detroit.  A family of four attempted to leave a video store in Woodhaven during the height of the storm.  As the group left the building, a severe wind gust struck an awning located above the exit.  The awning was ripped off the building, and the brickwork the awning was attached to came with it.  The falling bricks proved deadly, as a young boy was killed instantly when his head was crushed.  His father suffered serious injuries to internal organs and his pelvic region, and succumbed to those injuries two and a half weeks later.  The other two children in the group were treated at the scene for minor injuries.Three other individuals were injured during the severe thunderstorm episode.  Ironically, the first injury of the event was also due to an awning collapse - this one in northwest Lenawee County.  Severe winds struck a campground near Michigan Speedway, where a major auto race would take place during the upcoming weekend.  The awning of a camper was blown down, injuring a bystander.  In Waterford (Oakland County), a young woman was struck by lightning at a park.  She required an overnight hospitalization.  In Macomb County, a man in St Clair Shores was knocked unconscious when a falling tree struck the car he was in.  His injuries also necessitated a brief hospital stay.The damage was almost exclusively confined to the southern three tiers of counties in southeast Michigan.  The one exception was in extreme western Shiawassee County, just east of Elsie, where a thunderstorm outflow downed large limbs and power lines.  Most of the damage was located in the heavily populated Detroit area.  Downed trees and power lines were common, and there were a few reports of large hail.The first county in southeast Michigan to be affected by severe weather was Lenawee.  Trees were downed in Ridgeway, Britton, Addison, and Deerfield.  Britton also received the largest hail during the entire severe weather episode.  In Tecumseh, two vehicles were damaged by fallen trees.  Roof damage at Tecumseh City Hall led to computer systems inside being destroyed by exposure to the elements.  Adrian was hit hard as well.  Numerous homes were damaged by fallen trees, and a radio tower at the sheriff department was knocked out of service.  Trees were downed just northeast of town.  Many trees, limbs, and power lines were downed in Hudson, with numerous cars hit by debris, and the roof of a business destroyed.  Amateur radio operators north of Addison and northeast of Adrian both estimated 65 mph winds.Severe thunderstorms struck Washtenaw County just minutes after first impacting Lenawee.  The communities of Chelsea, Dexter, and Manchester all saw some tree damage, but wind damage was more extensive between Chelsea and Manchester.  Thunderstorm winds laid over a corn field in Lodi Township, northwest of Saline.  Saline itself saw substantial damage: many trees were downed, heavily damaging a home and a vehicle; store windows were blown out in town; and, a screened-in porch was removed from its house.The thunderstorms continued to intensify as they moved east into the densely populated Ann Arbor-Ypsilanti area.  Ann Arbor Municipal Airport measured a 75 mph wind gust, which blew two hangars off their foundations, damaged the doors of three hangars, and damaged several planes.  At least 75 trees were downed in Ann Arbor, most on the south side of town.  Ypsilanti was hit even harder.  Falling trees damaged numerous homes and vehicles, and several traffic signals came crashing down.  Gas pumps just south of the city were blown over.  Cleanup efforts in Ypsilanti took five weeks to complete.  South of Ypsilanti, several trees were downed in Milan, one of which demolished a car.  Many trees were uprooted in Augusta Township, just east of Milan.In Oakland County, thunderstorm winds downed a traffic signal in Highland.  Trees, limbs, and power lines were downed in a number of suburban communities, including Farmington, Bloomfield Township, Royal Oak, Troy, Clawson, Madison Heights, and Hazel Park.  Power lines fell on Interstate 75 near Rochester Road, closing that busy highway for more than an hour.  In Pontiac, a replica of the Vietnam Veterans Memorial Wall was toppled; it was constructed to withstand 80 mph gusts.  A spotter in Rochester Hills estimated 60 mph winds with one thunderstorm.The south half of neighboring Macomb County was hit hard by severe thunderstorms.  Spotters in the south part of Sterling Heights reported dime sized hail and 76 mph winds.  In Warren, spotters reported gusts up to 75 mph.  The stretch of county between 10 and 12 Mile Roads, from Warren east to St Clair Shores, took the brunt of the storms.  Damage was extensive in Warren, Roseville, and St Clair Shores, with hundreds of downed trees and power lines.  Newspaper stands and store signs were knocked over in Warren.  In Roseville and Fraser, windows and roofs were removed from stores.  Further north, an office building in Mt Clemens was declared a total loss after it was deroofed by severe winds.  In nearby Harrison Township, power lines were downed.Damage was not quite as extensive in Monroe County.  Trees and power lines were downed in several locations in the county.  The electrical connections of several homes in Temperance were damaged.  Many trees were downed in the city of Monroe, where a home was damaged by a falling tree, while another had its porch destroyed.  A home was also heavily damaged by a falling tree in Stony Point.  Barns were deroofed in both Carleton and Exeter Township, while a garage was moved off its foundation in Carleton.However, the most intense damage of the episode occurred in the most populated county in the state: Wayne County.  The worst destruction was in Dearborn and Dearborn Heights.  Between the two cities, over 500 trees were downed, almost a thousand homes suffered some sort of damage, and thirty vehicles were destroyed.  In Dearborn, large chunks of the city were essentially defoliated, with over ten thousand trees damaged.  The worst damage was around the Michigan Avenue/Cherry Hill Road intersection.  Dearborn Heights reported over twelve hundred wires downed, and fifteen water mains were broken by uprooted trees.   Cleanup in the Dearborns was expected to continue into October.Damage was widespread, but not quite as intense, in the communities surrounding the Dearborns.  Some stores along Telegraph Road were damaged on the far northwest side of Detroit.  Dozens of limbs and power lines were downed in Redford.  The southeast part of Livonia saw trees uprooted, power lines down, and cars and homes damaged.  In Westland, forty trees were toppled, and the roof of an automobile showroom was blown away.  Many trees were downed in Garden City, especially on the east side.  Some roofs were damaged, windows were broken, and the deck of a home was destroyed.  There were many downed lines in Canton Township, with downed trees and lines in the city of Wayne.  In Inkster, one home was considered a total loss after a tree fell on it, and five other homes were damaged.Another swath of damaging winds began further south, around Detroit Metropolitan Airport.  Wind gusts of 58 mph caused the control tower to be evacuated, resulting in dozens of flights being cancelled or rerouted.  Two out of the three electrical feeds to the airport were disabled, resulting in continued problems into the next day.  Substantial damage also took place in the nearby cities of Romulus and Taylor.  This damage swath continued east to the Detroit River, with damage reported in the cities of Southgate, Lincoln Park, Ecorse, and River Rouge.  Two homes suffered major damage in Allen Park, while in Wyandotte, thirty homes and six businesses were damaged.An additional damage swath occurred across the far downriver suburbs.  This included Woodhaven, where the two fatalities occurred.  Storm damage also occurred in Flat Rock, Gibraltar, and Trenton.  On Grosse Ile, one hundred homes suffered some sort of damage, along with two businesses.  An automated observing system on Grosse Ile recorded a 62 mph gust.Yet another area of storm damage was in and near downtown Detroit.  At Wayne State University, windows were blown out at State Hall, and the press box of the football stadium collapsed into the stands below.  Many power lines were downed near Michigan and Livernois Avenues.  Downtown, a lawn chair was tossed up onto the track of the People Mover, a monorail system.  The next train by ran the chair over, causing damage to both train and track.  Also downtown, empty boxcars were rolled by the wind along a railroad track and into a building, causing significant structural damage.Finally, the far northeast part of Wayne County was on the fringe of the damage swath that hit southern Macomb County.  Harper Woods and all five of the Grosse Pointes saw tree limbs and power lines come down.  At Pier Park in Grosse Pointe Farms, several trees that had survived the 90+ mph winds of July 2, 1997, came crashing down.Overall, more than a thousand trees and five thousand power lines were downed in southeast Michigan.  Over 600,000 businesses and residences lost power at some point.  For Detroit Edison, this was the fourth worst weather system of all time regarding power outages.  The power was out for over a week in spots.  The storms also produced over 4300 cloud-to-ground lightning strikes.  Wayne County and parts of Macomb County received both state and federal disaster declarations.",,PDC

Barns were deroofed in both Carleton and Exeter Township, while a garage was moved off its foundation in Carleton.However, the most intense damage of the episode occurred in the most populated county in the state: Wayne County.  The worst destruction was in Dearborn and Dearborn Heights.  Between the two cities, over 500 trees were downed, almost a thousand homes suffered some sort of damage, and thirty vehicles were destroyed.  In Dearborn, large chunks of the city were essentially defoliated, with over ten thousand trees damaged.  The worst damage was around the Michigan Avenue/Cherry Hill Road intersection.  Dearborn Heights reported over twelve hundred wires downed, and fifteen water mains were broken by uprooted trees.   Cleanup in the Dearborns was expected to continue into October.Damage was widespread, but not quite as intense, in the communities surrounding the Dearborns.  Some stores along Telegraph Road were damaged on the far northwest side of Detroit.  Dozens of limbs and power lines were downed in Redford.  The southeast part of Livonia saw trees uprooted, power lines down, and cars and homes damaged.  In Westland, forty trees were toppled, and the roof of an automobile showroom was blown away.  Many trees were downed in Garden City, especially on the east side.  Some roofs were damaged, windows were broken, and the deck of a home was destroyed.  There were many downed lines in Canton Township, with downed trees and lines in the city of Wayne.  In Inkster, one home was considered a total loss after a tree fell on it, and five other homes were damaged.Another swath of damaging winds began further south, around Detroit Metropolitan Airport.  Wind gusts of 58 mph caused the control tower to be evacuated, resulting in dozens of flights being cancelled or rerouted.  Two out of the three electrical feeds to the airport were disabled, resulting in continued problems into the next day.  Substantial damage also took place in the nearby cities of Romulus and Taylor.  This damage swath continued east to the Detroit River, with damage reported in the cities of Southgate, Lincoln Park, Ecorse, and River Rouge.  Two homes suffered major damage in Allen Park, while in Wyandotte, thirty homes and six businesses were damaged.An additional damage swath occurred across the far downriver suburbs.  This included Woodhaven, where the two fatalities occurred.  Storm damage also occurred in Flat Rock, Gibraltar, and Trenton.  On Grosse Ile, one hundred homes suffered some sort of damage, along with two businesses.  An automated observing system on Grosse Ile recorded a 62 mph gust.Yet another area of storm damage was in and near downtown Detroit.  At Wayne State University, windows were blown out at State Hall, and the press box of the football stadium collapsed into the stands below.  Many power lines were downed near Michigan and Livernois Avenues.  Downtown, a lawn chair was tossed up onto the track of the People Mover, a monorail system.  The next train by ran the chair over, causing damage to both train and track.  Also downtown, empty boxcars were rolled by the wind along a railroad track and into a building, causing significant structural damage.Finally, the far northeast part of Wayne County was on the fringe of the damage swath that hit southern Macomb County.  Harper Woods and all five of the Grosse Pointes saw tree limbs and power lines come down.  At Pier Park in Grosse Pointe Farms, several trees that had survived the 90+ mph winds of July 2, 1997, came crashing down.Overall, more than a thousand trees and five thousand power lines were downed in southeast Michigan.  Over 600,000 businesses and residences lost power at some point.  For Detroit Edison, this was the fourth worst weather system of all time regarding power outages.  The power was out for over a week in spots.  The storms also produced over 4300 cloud-to-ground lightning strikes.  Wayne County and parts of Macomb County received both state and federal disaster declarations.",,PDC

An extremely humid airmass was also in place, with dew points in the upper 70s.  The above produced an extraordinarily unstable atmosphere, with CAPE values approaching 7000 J/kg.  A weak trough of low pressure moved east into western lower Michigan during the afternoon.  It was on this trough that thunderstorms first developed.  Thanks to the amount of instability present, these storms rapidly became severe.  Winds aloft were rather strong for mid-summer, with 40 knot winds less than a mile above ground level (at 850 mb).  Thus, the storms were prodigious producers of damaging wind gusts.Tragedy struck during the early evening in the downriver suburbs of Detroit.  A family of four attempted to leave a video store in Woodhaven during the height of the storm.  As the group left the building, a severe wind gust struck an awning located above the exit.  The awning was ripped off the building, and the brickwork the awning was attached to came with it.  The falling bricks proved deadly, as a young boy was killed instantly when his head was crushed.  His father suffered serious injuries to internal organs and his pelvic region, and succumbed to those injuries two and a half weeks later.  The other two children in the group were treated at the scene for minor injuries.Three other individuals were injured during the severe thunderstorm episode.  Ironically, the first injury of the event was also due to an awning collapse - this one in northwest Lenawee County.  Severe winds struck a campground near Michigan Speedway, where a major auto race would take place during the upcoming weekend.  The awning of a camper was blown down, injuring a bystander.  In Waterford (Oakland County), a young woman was struck by lightning at a park.  She required an overnight hospitalization.  In Macomb County, a man in St Clair Shores was knocked unconscious when a falling tree struck the car he was in.  His injuries also necessitated a brief hospital stay.The damage was almost exclusively confined to the southern three tiers of counties in southeast Michigan.  The one exception was in extreme western Shiawassee County, just east of Elsie, where a thunderstorm outflow downed large limbs and power lines.  Most of the damage was located in the heavily populated Detroit area.  Downed trees and power lines were common, and there were a few reports of large hail.The first county in southeast Michigan to be affected by severe weather was Lenawee.  Trees were downed in Ridgeway, Britton, Addison, and Deerfield.  Britton also received the largest hail during the entire severe weather episode.  In Tecumseh, two vehicles were damaged by fallen trees.  Roof damage at Tecumseh City Hall led to computer systems inside being destroyed by exposure to the elements.  Adrian was hit hard as well.  Numerous homes were damaged by fallen trees, and a radio tower at the sheriff department was knocked out of service.  Trees were downed just northeast of town.  Many trees, limbs, and power lines were downed in Hudson, with numerous cars hit by debris, and the roof of a business destroyed.  Amateur radio operators north of Addison and northeast of Adrian both estimated 65 mph winds.Severe thunderstorms struck Washtenaw County just minutes after first impacting Lenawee.  The communities of Chelsea, Dexter, and Manchester all saw some tree damage, but wind damage was more extensive between Chelsea and Manchester.  Thunderstorm winds laid over a corn field in Lodi Township, northwest of Saline.  Saline itself saw substantial damage: many trees were downed, heavily damaging a home and a vehicle; store windows were blown out in town; and, a screened-in porch was removed from its house.The thunderstorms continued to intensify as they moved east into the densely populated Ann Arbor-Ypsilanti area.  Ann Arbor Municipal Airport measured a 75 mph wind gust, which blew two hangars off their foundations, damaged the doors of three hangars, and damaged several planes.  At least 75 trees were downed in Ann Arbor, most on the south side of town.  Ypsilanti was hit even harder.  Falling trees damaged numerous homes and vehicles, and several traffic signals came crashing down.  Gas pumps just south of the city were blown over.  Cleanup efforts in Ypsilanti took five weeks to complete.  South of Ypsilanti, several trees were downed in Milan, one of which demolished a car.  Many trees were uprooted in Augusta Township, just east of Milan.In Oakland County, thunderstorm winds downed a traffic signal in Highland.  Trees, limbs, and power lines were downed in a number of suburban communities, including Farmington, Bloomfield Township, Royal Oak, Troy, Clawson, Madison Heights, and Hazel Park.  Power lines fell on Interstate 75 near Rochester Road, closing that busy highway for more than an hour.  In Pontiac, a replica of the Vietnam Veterans Memorial Wall was toppled; it was constructed to withstand 80 mph gusts.  A spotter in Rochester Hills estimated 60 mph winds with one thunderstorm.The south half of neighboring Macomb County was hit hard by severe thunderstorms.  Spotters in the south part of Sterling Heights reported dime sized hail and 76 mph winds.  In Warren, spotters reported gusts up to 75 mph.  The stretch of county between 10 and 12 Mile Roads, from Warren east to St Clair Shores, took the brunt of the storms.  Damage was extensive in Warren, Roseville, and St Clair Shores, with hundreds of downed trees and power lines.  Newspaper stands and store signs were knocked over in Warren.  In Roseville and Fraser, windows and roofs were removed from stores.  Further north, an office building in Mt Clemens was declared a total loss after it was deroofed by severe winds.  In nearby Harrison Township, power lines were downed.Damage was not quite as extensive in Monroe County.  Trees and power lines were downed in several locations in the county.  The electrical connections of several homes in Temperance were damaged.  Many trees were downed in the city of Monroe, where a home was damaged by a falling tree, while another had its porch destroyed.  A home was also heavily damaged by a falling tree in Stony Point.

The storms focused on a pair of east-west oriented boundaries: one stretched across central lower Michigan, while the second was a weak warm front moving north into the southern portion of the state.  Thunderstorms near both boundaries became severe.Storms near the northern boundary were hail producers.  Golfball sized hail was reported by a spotter in Sanford, and also by the Michigan State Police northwest of Pinconning.  Dime to quarter sized hail was reported at a number of other locations in Midland and Bay Counties.Along the warm front, a large supercell developed in south-central Michigan.  It moved east and then turned southeast across southeast Michigan.  Hardest hit was Washtenaw County, most notably around Chelsea, and from Milan to Whittaker.  These locations were affected by parts of the supercell for an extended period of time.  Severe weather started in the area around and north of Chelsea, where golfball sized hail fell.  A lightning strike started a house fire north of Chelsea.  Quarter sized hail fell in Chelsea about 20 minutes later, but this part of the storm was more noted for the wind damage it caused.  Trees were downed in Sylvan, Chelsea, and Lima.  A truck was destroyed by a fallen tree in Sylvan, and a few homes in Chelsea were damaged in a similar manner.  Wind gusts also destroyed in barn in Lima.  The wind was estimated at 75 mph in Chelsea.The supercell covered the Milan-Whittaker area with golfball sized hail.  A spotter in Whittaker estimated 70 mph winds.  Again, a second component of the large supercell caused severe weather 15 to 20 minutes later.

Only the northeast corner of Lenawee County was grazed, as trees were downed near Macon.  Monroe County took a more substantial hit.  A golfer at Thorn Hills Golf Club, northeast of Maybee, was hurt when a large tree limb fell on him.  Trees were also downed in Dundee and Raisinville Township.  A spotter estimated 60 mph winds in Maybee, as did emergency management officials just south of Carleton.  Dime sized hail fell at the Fermi II Nuclear Power Plant.

That would be the only severe hail event; the rest of the day was filled with damaging wind gusts.  A 66 mph gust was measured at the National Weather Service office in White Lake, while a spotter estimated 70 mph winds near downtown Detroit.Most the damage caused by the wind involved downed trees and power lines.  Trees were downed onto homes in the city of Midland, White Lake, Lake Orion, Pontiac, and Deerfield Township (Lapeer County).  Deerfield Township was especially hard hit, as some roads were closed for several days due to tree debris. A number of tents at the Ann Arbor Art Fair were demolished.  Vehicles were destroyed in White Lake and Port Huron when trees fell on them.  A large awning was blown off the roof of a Canton strip mall, and the roof of a hangar at the Oakland County International Airport in Waterford was displaced by the wind.  Panelling was torn off the press box at Tiger Stadium in Detroit.  In St Clair Shores, a garage collapsed, moored sailboats were tipped over, and part of an aluminum roof was peeled off a warehouse.Locally heavy rainfall occurred with some of the thunderstorms, especially in metro Detroit.  Freeway underpasses were flooded in Detroit, as were fifty basements in Dearborn.  The thunderstorm hazard resulted in over a hundred flights at Detroit Metropolitan Airport being either delayed or cancelled.  The Reform Party national convention in Dearborn was seriously disrupted, as several scheduled speakers - including Minnesota Governor Jesse Ventura - could not fly into Detroit.",,PDC

Rainfall amounts were as high as 3.58 inches at Detroit Metro Airport, 3.5 inches in Monroe, 2.5 inches in Macomb County, and 2.09 inches in White Lake.  Radar estimated as much as four inches of rain fell in parts of Monroe, Wayne, and Oakland Counties.  Some spotty urban flooding resulted, closing roads during the busy late afternoon rush hour.  In addition, the thunderstorms seriously disrupted air travel at Detroit Metro Airport.  Over 160 flights were cancelled, and all traffic at the airport was halted for a half hour period during the afternoon.During the closest approach of the low pressure system, east winds increased dramatically.  A brief surge of wind in mid afternoon brought gusts to around 40 mph.  A few power lines were downed here and there, but the worst of the wind was three miles north of Utica, where a tree fell on a home.",,PDC

The tornado strengthened as it hit the Horseshoe Bend Subdivision with winds estimated at 120 mph and structural damage to the outside of homes. The tornado then continued to track southeast alongside Dexter-Pinckney Rd. and produced EF-3 damage at 5:31pm. Winds estimated at 135-140 mph destroyed one home northwest of Dexter. The tornado then made a left turn and paralleled Huron River Dr. producing EF-2 damage on the north side of Dexter. The tornado then produced EF-3 damage again at 5:49pm in the Huron Farms Subdivision with winds estimated at 135-140 mph. One home was destroyed and another house had only interior rooms left standing.
